Supports a good set of WS protocols (see Java-Websocket's readme for more info) and implements both a WebSocket 
client and server.

Feedback

* Please submit feedback via Github issues! We are still in the very early stages of this library, so we'd love
anything from aesthetic suggestions to bug reports.
